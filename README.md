# Pomodoro-Clock

A Pomodoro is a style of working where you work for 25 minutes and take a 5 minute break. This is one of Free Code Camp's Advanced Front End Development Projects. The clock starts when the user clicks the start button. A buzzer sounds once the session time is up and the break time immediately starts afterwards. The user can then click the restart button to restart the session time.
